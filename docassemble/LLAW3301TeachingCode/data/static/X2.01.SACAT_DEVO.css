/* This is a style or a 'class'.  This class is part of a 'Bootstrap' theme.
    Docassemble makes use of Bootstrap themes.  Bootstrap is what provides the
    navbar at the top, the style of the buttons.  It is also what allows the
    website to run on computers and iPads and smartphones.  We can customise
    elements of the theme to suit our needs.  That is what the next few classes
    do.  For more information on Bootstrap check out https://getbootstrap.com

    /* All colours in IT are set using RGB (ie: Red, Green, Blue) values.
       Each value of red, green and blue is a number between 0 and 255.
       Comon colour values are:
       - red:    rgb(255, 0, 0)
       - blue:   rgb(0, 255, 0)
       - green:  rgb(0, 0, 255)
       - yellow: rgb(0, 255, 255)
       - black:  rgb(0, 0, 0)
       - white:  rgb(255, 255, 255)
       The whole spectrum of colours can be represented by any combination
       of RGB values.  To choose a colour you need to know its RGB value.
       To work that out, use MS Paint or Excel to set a colour.  Most software
       comes with colour picking software that will show you the RGB values
       for any colour you pick
  
       DEVO Note -  swapped to rgba function with transparency set to 0, ie fully transparent bar.
       This enables the spinner to be seen, no longer covered by the bar; its transparent!
       Did not find a way to bring the spinner to the front, ie. top layer on form

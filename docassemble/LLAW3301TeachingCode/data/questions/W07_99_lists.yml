# Demonstration of how lists work
# Not used in class but may be useful as a resource
---
# First of all, you must declare your lists
objects:
  - MJFquestions: DAList
  - MJFanswers: DAList
---
# Mandatory block displays output
mandatory: True
question: List of Questions and Answers
subquestion: |
  Here's how to display a specific entry, 
  for example `MJFquestions[0]`: ${ MJFquestions[0] }
  
  
  Here's how to display all the entries in the list:
  
  Question|Answer
  ---|----
  % for MJFquestion in MJFquestions:
  ${ MJFquestion } | ${ MJFanswers[loop.index] }
  % endfor
  
  We could just dump the entire lists like this:
  
  - All the questions: ${ MJFquestions }
  - All the answers: ${ MJFanswers }
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart

question: Enter a question and answer
fields:
  - Question: MJFquestions[i]
  - Answer:   MJFanswers[i]
  - Is this the last question/answer?: MJFlastanswer
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Yes
      - No
    default: No

# The property 'there_is_another' is a special property.  While it
# is true, Docassemble will continue to populate the list.  Once it
# is set to false, Docassmble assumes the list (or lists in our case)
# are complete
code: |
  if MJFlastanswer == 'Yes':
    MJFquestions.there_is_another = False
    MJFanswers.there_is_another = False
  else:
    MJFquestions.there_is_another = True
    MJFanswers.there_is_another = True
---
# The property 'there_are_any' is also a special property.  It needs to be
# set to True if you are to gather any questions/answers at all.  You could
# do this interactively (ie: ask an initial question like 'Do you want to
# collect questions and answers' and set there_are_any depending on whether 
# the user clicks 'yes' or 'no'.  But in our case we know we always want at
# least one question, so we set there_are_any to True for both DALists
code: |
  MJFquestions.there_are_any = True
  MJFanswers.there_are_any = True

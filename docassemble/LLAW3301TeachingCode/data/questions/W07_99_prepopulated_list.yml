# First of all, you must declare your lists
objects:
  - MJFquestions: DAList
  - MJFanswers: DAList

# You can pre-declare a list
variable name: MJFquestions
data:
  - What is your name?
  - What is your address?

question: List of Questions and Answers
subquestion: |
  Here's how to display a specific entry, 
  for example `MJFquestions[0]`: ${ MJFquestions[0] }
  
  
  Here's how to display all the entries in the list:
  
  Question|Answer
  ---|----
  % for MJFindex in range(len(MJFquestions)):
  ${ MJFquestions[MJFindex] } | ${ MJFanswers[MJFindex] }
  % endfor
  
  We could just dump the entire lists like this:
  
  - All the questions: ${ MJFquestions }
  - All the answers: ${ MJFanswers }
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart

question: ${ MJFquestions[i] }
fields:
  - Answer:   MJFanswers[i]

# We dont' need to ask whether there are any more questions to ask as we
# know exactly how many questions to ask.  So, we stop when we get to the
# last question asked.
code: |
  if len(MJFquestions) == len(MJFanswers):
    MJFanswers.there_is_another = False
  else:
    MJFanswers.there_is_another = True
---
# We don't need to set there_are_any for MJFquestions as it's pre-declared
# But we still need to set it for MJFanswers
code: |
  MJFanswers.there_are_any = True
---
# Because you pre-declared the MJFquestions list you need to tell Docassemble
# that it contains the complete list of questions
code: |
  MJFquestions.there_is_another = False
